Put in your Hugging Face AI API Key into your .env file if you want to incorporate AI analyses within your project overview.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

DevAssist offers three methods for code analysis:

1. Local folder upload
2. GitHub repository URL analysis
3. Direct code pasting

Each analysis provides comprehensive insights through our four analysis modules, displayed in an intuitive tabbed interface.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with:

- Core analysis engine
- AI-powered processing (optional Hugging Face API integration)
- Parallel processing of analysis modules
- Real-time result aggregation and visualization

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Performance and Security

- No sensitive data sent to external services without consent
- Local analysis options for sensitive codebases
- No data persistence beyond session
- 10MB file size limit for optimal performance
- Dynamic imports and lazy loading for efficiency
